# Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of baseline information from the DIY SlimeVR Community.

These are pieces of information and resources that should be fundamental understandings, without duplicating information from the official SlimeVR Docs. For example, temperature calibration (TCAL) is a suitable topic for these docs because it's specific enough not to be covered in the official documentation but still relevant to those interested in the experimental side of DIY slimes.

While it's tempting to update every bit of documentation with every detail, keeping up with the fast-paced changes within the community can be challenging. Therefore, information posted here should focus on confirmed, accurate, community-approved fundamentals.
